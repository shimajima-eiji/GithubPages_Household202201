<p>chocolateyがどういうものかは<a href="https://qiita.com/kangetsu121/items/b6352b547cd32e71bc65" id="reference-00705c7391b98852978b">他の方の記事</a>を参照していただいた方がいいです。<br>
雑に言うと、</p>

<ul>
<li>windowsでもchocoでyumやらaptっぽいコマンドの振る舞いをさせて</li>
<li>作った環境を他のwindows端末にも持っていける</li>
</ul>

<p>ものです。<br>
これで、新しい端末を使うたびにいちいちダウンロードサイトまで行ってほげほげする必要がなくなります。</p>

<p>どれができて、どれがだめなん？って情報は重要ですよね。</p>

<div class="code-frame" data-lang="cmd"><div class="highlight"><pre><code>choco list (なんとか)

<p>で、それっぽいものは引けるんですが、何となく眺めたくなったので。<br>
「これも入れられるんだ！」っていう気付きにどうぞ。<br>

<p>とりあえずChocolateyGUI入れて画面から管理できるようにすると捗ります。<br>
そちらだと1ページずつ更新するたびに時間がかかってどうしようもないので、choco listで見た方が楽かもしれません。<br>
なお、choco installとGUI間できちんと連携されていました。</p>
